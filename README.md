C++ AVL Tree Implementation
This repository contains a C++ implementation of an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL trees maintain their balance during insertions and deletions, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with a logarithmic time complexity.

Overview
AVL trees are binary search trees with the additional property that the height of the two child subtrees of every node differs by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, preventing degeneration into a linked list and maintaining efficient operations.

This implementation is split across three files: AVL.hpp (header file), AVL.cpp (implementation file), and main.cpp (main program). The separation of the header and implementation files allows for modularity and clean code organization.

Features
Self-Balancing: AVL trees automatically balance themselves, ensuring efficient operations.
Insertion, Deletion, and Search: Standard binary search tree operations are supported.
Modular Design: The code is organized in a modular fashion for easy understanding and extensibility.
Well-Commented Code: Extensive comments in the code for clear understanding.
File Structure
AVL.hpp: Header file containing the class declaration for the AVL tree.
AVL.cpp: Implementation file containing the definitions for the AVL tree methods.
main.cpp: Main program demonstrating the usage of the AVL tree.
Usage
To use the AVL tree in your C++ project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/avl-tree-cpp.git
Include the header file AVL.hpp in your main program.
Implement the AVL tree operations using the provided methods.
Refer to the example section for a quick demonstration.

Installation
There is no separate installation process required. Simply include the necessary files in your C++ project.

Example
cpp
Copy code
// main.cpp
#include "AVL.hpp"

int main() {
    // Create an AVL tree
    AVLTree<int> avlTree;

    // Insert elements
    avlTree.insert(10);
    avlTree.insert(5);
    avlTree.insert(15);

    // Search for an element
    bool result = avlTree.search(5);
    std::cout << "Search Result: " << result << std::endl;

    // Delete an element
    avlTree.remove(10);

    // Print the AVL tree
    avlTree.printTree();

    return 0;
}
